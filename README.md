# FoodAI
 A skeleton for a gpt powered food assistant that runs on the terminal
 A little project that has potential but I'm not motivated to continue.
 Feel free to do whatever with it :)
 
 # Instructions
 * Install the required libraries via the the requirements.txt
 * Put your open api key and clarifai key(https://docs.clarifai.com/clarifai-basics/authentication/app-specific-api-keys/) in keys.py
 * You may need to change the proxy in main.py to match your proxy, especially if you are in China
 * Run main.py :)
